 Macro/MediaPad with 4 MX style switches + 1 Clickable Dial, using a ProMicro or equivalent.
 
 -Hotswap & Per key adressable RGB (SK6812 mini/3535)
 -Reversible design, use it with the dial to the left/right or with the LED south/north facing depending on preference.
 -Stackable, connect the RGB LED's together to a single string and use more than one board per ProMicro.
 -Clearance for up to 30 mm dial.
 
 The plan is to make a 3D printable case for the board and the ProMicro that can either be used on your desk as is, or mounted underneath the edge of a screen.
